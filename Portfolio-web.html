        <h1 class="interhead">Web Design</h1>

        <p class="headerp">My web design experience cultivated in an interactive media class I took in
          Fall Quarter of my senior year of college at UC Davis. Leaving discussion
          of this website for last, here are two early examples of my web designs for
          this class. All of my web designs to this date are coded from scratch with
          HTML and stylized with CSS.

              <h2>Blog</h2>

              <p>This is a blog I created for class to organize occasional assignments. I
                designed my page organization into buttons and each button goes to an inner-page
                talking about the topic assigned. I critiqued websites on design, responsiveness,
                talk about making a demo website provided by my professor and a response to
                an article about web design. It's fully functional and a place where I explored
                HTML structure and CSS styling. This was my first multi-page functional website.

              <h2>Design Matters</h2>

              <p>This website was our "Design Matters" project. We had to choose a design
                technology, from any point in time, and create a 5 page website discussing
                the overview of how the technology works, the past, the present and the future
                of the technology. I chose screen
                printing, not only for my passion for it, but also it's impact on
                visual design throughout history and today.</p>

              <p>In the web design itself, I used a screen print work station for the head
                banner and the footer, which I felt added a nice color background. In the nav
                I made a direct reference to the technology of screen printing. The nav bar
                is green like the emulsion of the frame and the letters are white, making the
                small squeegee at the far right appear to have painted on those words. This
                was my little easter egg of my whole design.
