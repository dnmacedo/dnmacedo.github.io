    <p>My primary passion before design has always been art. I started drawing when
      I was 7, but the interest in fine arts and crafts didn't cease there. Whether
      it's sketching, painting, sculpting, jewelry making, constructing, screen printing,
      candle making, even baking-- anything that I can do with my hands is the thing
      I enjoy most as a passtime. My artwork most relevent to design includes paintings,
      drawings, and screen printing designs, which are detailed down below.

        <h2>Blog</h2>

        <p>This is a blog I created for class to organize occasional assignments. I
          designed my page organization into buttons and each button goes to an inner-page
          talking about the topic assigned. I critiqued websites on design, responsiveness,
          talk about making a demo website provided by my professor and a response to
          an article about web design. It's fully functional and a place where I explored
          HTML structure and CSS styling. This was my first multi-page functional website.

        <h2>Design Matters</h2>

        </a>

        <p>This website was our "Design Matters" project. We had to choose a design
          technology, from any point in time, and create a 5 page website discussing
          the overview of how the technology works, the past, the present and the future
          of the technology. I chose screen
          printing, not only for my passion for it, but also it's impact on
          visual design throughout history and today.</p>

        <p>In the web design itself, I used a screen print work station for the head
          banner and the footer, which I felt added a nice color background. In the nav
          I made a direct reference to the technology of screen printing. The nav bar
          is green like the emulsion of the frame and the letters are white, making the
          small squeegee at the far right appear to have painted on those words. This
          was my little easter egg of my whole design.
