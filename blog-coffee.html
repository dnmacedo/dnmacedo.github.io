            <h2>Coffee Website</h2>
            <p>Some difficulties I faced when making the roasters page was trying to decide what to preserve from the home page on the new page. I decided to add different background images to each page to keep them distinct from one another.
            I tried adding a background image, which only took a google search. I learned that using a url was the easiest way to go about putting an image into the background. I also learned how to grab an image from a website that I wanted and view the url. However, this url was not successful in my attempt to display it in the background.
            I didn’t have trouble linking a url image to the home page background, but I did have some trouble linking the given coffee beans photo to the “Our roasters” page. I’m not sure what I did wrong, so I decided to stick to one background image for both pages.
