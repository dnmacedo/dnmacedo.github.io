            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born in Orange, CA and grew up in Yorba Linda, CA. I enjoyed
              art and math the most in highschool and went to UC Davis to study
              Psychology and Design. My hobbies include making jewelry, baking,
              drawing, taking pictures, binge watching music videos and collecting
              vinyl records!
            </p>

              <p>I am in a family of 5, with an older sister, younger brother
              and Mom and Dad. My dog, Cooper, is a grumpy fur ball but very playful
              as well. He'll warm right up to you, as long as there's something
              in it for him!
            </p>

            <p>In the future I hope to be a freelance graphic designer, building
              relationships with clients and just making things for people! I grew
              up just making things for my friends, whether it was a drawing or
              a candle paper mache'd in Batman comic strips. I want to make things
              for people who need/want them. My work can be found on my portfolio (
              in my portal page).
            </p>

            <p>I recently really tok a liking to web coding and design, so I'm
              excited to see where that takes me as well!
            </p>
