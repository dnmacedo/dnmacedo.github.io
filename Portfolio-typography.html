    <h1 class="interhead">Typography</h1>

    <p class="headerp">These pieces of typography study came from a class I took
      in college exculively focused on the art and practice of typography. There
      I studied the close up detail of the letterform, using them to make artistic
      displays, practiced interesting word layouts and eventually recreated an
      existing poster solely with type.

        <h2>Type Poster Design</h2>

        <p>This piece is an alternative poster for a concert that Twenty-One Pilots
          was hosting. I decided to make the most important piece of information,
          the piece of info that the directed audience would be the most excited about,
          and enlarged it. I then played around with masks and made a texture pattern
          with randomly arranged V's in comic sans. It gave the larger letterforms
          an interesting texture and graphic element. I then put the rest of the
          important info at the bottom.</p>

        <p>This design reminds me how some posters were
          made in the psychadelic era of design. They share the feature of the
          information serving as a graphic texture and quality, however I think
          mine is considerably more legible.</p>

        <h2>Typographic art forms</h2>

        <p>These are exercises in which we used the letterform to make abstract
        artistic statements.They were assignments in which we looked closely or
        arranged them as a group to make them harmonious. Through these exercises
        I learned alot about appreciating the time and effort that goes into designing
        letterforms of typography.</p>

        <h2>Type arrangement</h2>

        <p>These are exercises where we took example information and had to arrange
        it with multiple variables of typographic features. In this exercise we
        practiced the use of space and grids. I went with a more experiemental
        approach, especially with the title. Similar to my alternative poster,
        I arranged the most important information as a graphic element that helps
        make the piece stronger as a whole.</p>
