        <h2>Future Predictions</h2>

        <p>There is no doubt that screen printing as a technology is ever-developing.
          With it’s most recent advancement, it is likely that screen printing will take
          over the advertising industry. We live in a day and age where energy efficiency
          and emissions are of large concern. Even though it pays a bit more to get a UV
          curing ink technology system, it’ll likely save money from elimination of other
          extra expenses and it will minimize impact on the environment.</p>

        <p>There’s modern technology that allows for screenprinting without the use of
          mesh material. Without reclaiming screens, they could be thrown away and essentially
          people could lose money that way and create landfill. So without the worry of
          inhaling fumes of reclaimer and contributing to landfills, a digitally etched
          stencil might help with that for the future. It is a metal sheet that is laser cut,
          increasing accuracy and time efficiency. This high precision engineering affords
          control of the process within a window of a few microns. It is also metal, so it
          is more likely to be recycled.</p>



        <p>The most interesting advancement has been at Department of Electronics
          and Computer Science at the University of Southampton. They managed to
          find a way to make the world’s first screen-printed digital watch. To
          make this even possible they used screen printed paste inks to apply
          the necessary, conductive, resistive and electroluminescent inks onto
          the fabric! There’s word going around about more “smart fabrics” such
           as this.</p>

           <p>It’s amazing to see how far screen printing has come. In the future
             we can expect to see this important and prevalent technology be more
              green, cheaper and combine electro-technological innovations integrated
              with fabric.</p>
