        <p>Screen printing is actually an ancient technique perfected over time and is
          still used today. The technology involves installing a porous mesh into a
          wooden or metal frame as to make a taught screen. This then is covered with
          a viscous liquid called emulsion which is water soluble depending on its
          exposure to UV light. Once exposed to UV light, the emulsion layer on the
          screen is no longer water soluble and can only be removed chemically with
          reclaimer.</p>



        <p>Making a stencil is pretty easy, you simply use a transparency of the shape
          you wish to make a stencil for and lay it with the screen underneath UV light.
          This allows everything to become hardened while the shape underneath the
          transparency remains water soluble. One can then scrub the emulsion off to
          reveal a stencil!</p>

        <p>Once the stencil is created, all you need to do is attach the screen to
          a screen print press and lay it down on your medium of choice (paper, t-shirt,
          etc). You then take ink of choice and pour a line of it above your shape.
          Lastly, with your squeegee, you swipe the ink with a firm grip across the
          stencil. Once the screen is lifted, the shape of the stencil has transferred,
          and that is the general process of screen printing!</p>

        <p>Many changes have occurred in the screen printingâ€™s development as a
            technology. Explore the tabs to learn more about more background and
            potential of screen printing.</p>
