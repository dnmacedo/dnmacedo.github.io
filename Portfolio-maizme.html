    <p class="headerp">For my Graphic Design Studio project, we were assigned to create/reinvent
       a food product that was innovative, human-centered and inspired by biomimicry.
       After we conceptualized our idea, we were required to construct the packaging
       for it. We weren't allowed to market a number of things like cookies and cereal,
       and our packaging was not allowed to be a box. You may scroll through this
       page and learn my journey or check out my official <a href="images/ProcessManual.pdf">Process Manual.</a>

        <h2>My Idea</h2>

        <p>I decided to take microwavable popcorn and reinterpret its branding and
          packaging. I wanted to make a healthy alternative to microwavable popcorn,
          for it contains carcinogens and chemicals that have been known to cause
          lung diseases. At first I started with the goal to make a healthier popping
          bag and heat resisent container, that could stand stable and spill-proof.</p>

        <p>I then explored on the idea of home-made popcorn. The only way you can make
          your own popcorn is with a microwavable bag, or buy a bottle of kernels, oil,
          and seasoning. So I made the most convenient form of a home-made popcorn kit.
          It includes the proper proportion of popcorn kernels (1/3cup), 2 tbs of coconut
          oil, and a seasoning compartment in the lid.
        </p>

        <h2>How it works</h2>

        <p>When using this product, the person would empty the contents of the
        Maizme container and follow instructions to cook microwavable popcorn over
        the stove. This is in effort to educate people about healthy snacking, give
        them a social opportunity to do something fun with others, as well as
        learn how to make something they've never done before.</p>

        <p>The last part of
        the process is they can just put the popcorn in a bowl, or use the spice
        mechanism installed in the lid. The Maizme package acts as a spill-proof
        container, and the person can load their popcorn in with the lid shut.
        The person would then find a unique "Pull" tab on the side of the lid and
        would pull firmly.</p>

        <p>This tab is attached to a compartment on the underside
        of the lid by a string, and when pulled out fully, seasoning is released.
        The snacker then can complete the process by giving the closed container
        a shake to distribute the seasoning, open and enjoy.</p>

        <h2>Branding</h2>

        <p>The branding for Maizme popcorn was designed to be tasty, friendly and promote
        this idea of a healthy snack alternative. I wanted to make it stand out from the
        cliche "blockbuster" look on microwavable popcorn. I wanted buyers to know they
        were going to buy an experience. </p>

        <p>My <a href="images/GraphicStd-Maizme.pdf">graphic standard
        </a> goes through all the ways to use and not use the logo I designed for this
        product. My graphic standard also includes a business system to further strengthen
        an understanding of the branding.</p>

        <h2>Packaging</h2>

        <p>The packaging comes with a small card that describes the goals/mission of
          Maizme. The packaging stands about 5" tall and 6" wide. It does take up
          a bit of space which might not be ideal for transport, but it's demsnions
          were chosen with intent. The packaging includes official nutrition facts
          label with ingredients included, as well as directions for cooking the popcorn.</p>

          <p>The packaging is made entirely from cardstock paper and a string so it
          is completely sustainable. To block the coconut oil on the cooked poporn
          from contaminating the good recyclable paper, there would be a wax paper lining
          that can be easily removed-- peace of mind for the environmentally-conscientious.
