        <h2>Screen Printing Today</h2>

        <p>Screen printing has come a long way over time with the
        introduction to new equipment and materials; screen emulsions
        inks, and solvents, surfactants, caustics and oxidizers. the
        essential tools used are the screen (or porous mesh), the
        squeegee and the ink. The stencil image can be made manually or photochemically.
        The thickness of the ink layer depends on the diameter of the
        threads and the thread count of the mesh; it will determine
        how much ink is deposited.</p>

        <p>Today, we have the privilage of automatic presses that do
          screen printing by machine. The development of the rotary
          screen press allows for continuous operation of the press by
          placing the screen on a conveyer belt.
        </p>



        <p>Rotary press is just one type of press. There are flat,
        cylinder and rotary presses for screen printing. Flat and
        cylinder are similar in that you simply press the screen down,
        squeegee and lift and these machines are designed for a flat or
        cylinder surface. Rotary involves thin cylinders that are filled
        with ink to keep a steady flow
        of color in the screen. Inside the bar is a magnetic squeegee
        whose pressure is monitored by magnets below the press bed.
        This method is best suited for textiles, wallpaper, and other
        products that require unbroken continuous patterns. </p>

        <p>The most recent advancement in screen print technology is
          UV curable inks. These have liquid prepolymers, monomers and
          initiators that when exposed to UV light instantly polymerizes
          the ink to a dry, tough thermosetting resin. This method is better
          than gas or electric driers, for it is not as hazordous and it also
          saves a lot of money. This is energy efficient for it reduces energy
          consumption by 40-50%! Old methods use mercury lamps which are more
        hazardous and emit more heat.</p>

          <p>Some inks like solvent inks result in VOC emissions.
          It is also known that water based inks may still
          emit small amounts of VOC from additives. A search for a "clean ink" may
         be underway.</p>
