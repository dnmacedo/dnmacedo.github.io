      <h1 class="interhead">Group Study 2016-17</h1>

      <p class="headerp">In my senior year of college, after I took a graphic design
        studio course with professor Gale Okumura, she invited me to work in a
        private study group among a handful of her other students that she hand
        picked from her classes. In this group study, we are exposed to real clients,
        that are usually local, who have design projects for us. The projects can vary
        from logos, to wayfinding to intereior design. This is where I was able
        to really apply my design skills.

        <h2>R.A.D. Logo Design</h2>

        <p>A small group in my group study was assigned to make a new logo for the
          on-campus Reading and Academic Development Center (R.A.D.). The R.A.D.
          center both practices research on kids and young adults who struggle with
          reading and learning skills, as well as provide training and rehabilitation
          services to improve their reading skills. They asked us to create a logo
          that would be representative of their facility.
        </p>

        <p>My groupmates all came up with our own ideas for the logo for the R.A.D.
          Center, but this one was my contribution. My group leader, Jessica Lam,
          had us make an empathy map, in which we would think of words that would
          best describe the things people at the Center, parent, child or researcher,
          would feel, say, do and think. For this logo, I made warm and welcoming to both
          child and parent, I decided to create this progressive and transformative
          look to the abstract forms, and even though the client did not want to
          be literal and have a book, she said that my logo looked like flipping
          pages, and she liked that. All in all, I think my logo has the voice that
          exemplifies the goals and qualities of the R.A.D. Center.
