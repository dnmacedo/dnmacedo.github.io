            <h2>Response to Article</h2>
            <p>I read the article A Redesign with CSS Shapes from the website
              A list Apart. I learned that css recently came out with this new
              concept of float shapes where you can make text float around any
              type of polygon you wish. In this article, the author took on the
              challenge of floating text around circles. One part I did not
              understand is why there was a right-hand side margin for the image
              element box. This affected the way the author had to center his
              float shape so that it would be centered to the image and not
              the entire element (including margin).
            </p>

            <p>I saw that he added a 20px buffer between the edge of the image
              and where the text would go. But my question is why does the text
              flow into the margin? Does the margin
              become meaningless once a float shape is set in place?
            </P>

            <p>After reading on, the article answered my question, and
              it was exactly what I was inquiring. “That’s the effect of
              shape-outside. Areas of the margin outside that shape, and even
              areas of the element’s content outside the shape, are available
              for normal-flow content to flow into.” So this sums up that margins
              don’t have the same effect here, but the shape must still be
              recentered onto the image itself, so that, the margin does affect.
              I also learned in this same section that the shape would get cut
              off if it stepped outside the margin, so I realized here that it
              still has function even
              if one of the functions has been override by the shape.
            </p>

            <p>The next part he covered is adjusting the code so that text
              wrap would still look nice near the shapes even when the viewport
              is scaled down. Which brings me to another sort of inquiry I had.
              He talks about using even and odd divs and giving them a margin.
              I’m not exactly sure which divs he is referring to, like perhaps
              the lines of text? My deduction is that the even div is the first
              block of text and the odd is the second. That is why the text
              wraps at a certain point underneath the bubble. I realize too
              that he used percentages instead of a fixed measurement so that
              these can adjust as the viewport is scaled up and down. Also,
              making the
              margin too wide would diminish the purpose of the float shape.
            </p>

            <p>I thought another cool thing he demonstrated is getting the
              general result he wanted on his page, whether or not a browser
              supported his float shape, all in 2 small blocks of code! So when
              he puts @support, he gets to set his desired margins for the
              text so that it wraps nicely with the shapes, and if a browser
              doesn’t support the shape, it will just stop at the previous
              lines of code with a standard 33% margin. I thought it was really
              cool how he could make his code adapt to different browsers
              like that.
              It shows that he is educated and efficient.
            </p>

            <p>I think this was a very interesting topic that he went over and
              it definitely inspires me to incorporate it in my own designs. It
              seems like around every corner I learn something new about CSS and
              it seems like the possibilities are endless!
              I am loving these moments where code meets creativity.
            </p>
