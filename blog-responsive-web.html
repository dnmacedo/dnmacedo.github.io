            <h2>Responsive Website</h2>
            <p>In this blog I am critiquing a responsive website. This website
              works well by means of both computer and tablet. The tablet view
              works even better for this website as it is vertical. The vertical
              orientation compliments this site due to the vertical orientation
              of the photo of focus on the site. The columns are legible and
              presents a consistency in the visual aesthetic of the website.
            </p>

            <p>Speaking of the visual aesthetic of the website, the monochromatic
              color scheme is very strong in this. The opacities and the layouts
              make this site interesting and makes me want to explore it.</p>

            <p>I will address the phone screen view as problematic for this website.
              For example, the picture in the background gets cut off and starts
              to repeat on the right. The text area looks decent and readable on
              the Galaxy S5, but on the iPhone 5, there is this odd block border
              on the right and the picture even disappears down below.</p>

            <p>I would say that the typography and overall design of this website
              is very strong. However, they did not make a design that was adaptable
              to the mobile platform. Much of the design gets lost and chopped up,
              especially regarding the background and leaves it confusing to navigate
              for the user.</p>
