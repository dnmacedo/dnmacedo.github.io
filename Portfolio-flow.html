        <h1 class="interhead">The Flow</h1>

        <p class="headerp">The Flow is a conceptual application meant to address the water drought
          in California. In my Graphitecture class, a class created by Professor Brett
          Snyder, we were asked to make a graphic program that would encourage users to
          interact with their environment to practice water waste prevention, or to
          educate themselves about the drought. My partner Gayatri Narayan and I worked in
          partnership and came up with an idea called "The Flow".

        <h2>About the app</h2>

        <p>My partner and I wanted to make an app that specifically focused on
          the danger of leaks, regarding the drought. Our project was inspired by
          an app called Wayz that alerts drivers where things are around them, such
          as police on duty. We wanted to make an app that could alert people where
          leaks are. Leaks contribute 17% of water waste in the United States-- which
          is a lot.  The info screen tells people why leaks are so important and also
          educates them on how to look for common leaks in their daily environment.
          This is the message we want to send out to users: to be aware of
          your surroundings and participate in a group effort to save water.

        <h2>Step 1: Sign Up</h2>

        <p>You first sign up for an account setting up a user name and general info.
        Then you are asked to set your location and radius of notifications that you
        wish to recieve from that location. People can set their locations for their
        home, a building they manage or even just their neighborhood. This allows users
        to be notified of leaks in their area and allows them to keep track of anything
        that needs attention.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Take action!</h2>

        <p id="takeaction">Once you sign up for the app you then have access to 3 main
        screens: report, repair and a general map. If you are walking by a building
        or on your way to the bathroom exit and you spot a leak, you can then fill
        out information about the leak to report it. After it is reported, a spot
        on the UC Davis map is marked with a flag, shaped like a water drop. That's
        all there is to it to report, it's pretty easy and users can collect points
        for how many leaks they report and can use them for special givaways.

        Repairing a leak starts with the map with all of its flagged leaks. The
          longer a leak goes unrepaired, its puddle grows larger to illustrate the
          severeness of that leak and that more and more water is being wasted. To
          repair, whether you own a building and want to repair your leak or you see
          a public leak, you simply click on the water drop flag and you are presented
          with some options. You can either knock on the person's door/leave a note if
          the leak is located at a person's home. Or you can call repair men to come
          repair your leak for your own building or a public space.

      <h2>Promo Video</h2>

      <p>Here is a promotional video my partner and I created together, which ended up
        being how our final project was required to be presented. In the end Gaya
        and I were proud of our idea and thought, and still think, it could take
        off and make a real difference in California.</p>
