    <h1 class="interhead">Typography</h1>

    <p class="headerp">These pieces of typography study came from a class I took
      in college exculively focused on the art and practice of typography. There
      I studied the close up detail of the letterform, using them to make artistic
      displays, practiced interesting word layouts and eventually recreated an
      existing poster solely with type.

        <h2>Alternative Type Poster Design</h2>

        <p>This piece is an alternative poster for a concert that Twenty-One Pilots
          was hosting. I decided to make the most important piece of information,
          the piece of info that the directed audience would be the most excited about,
          and enlarged it. I then played around with masks and made a texture pattern
          with randomly arranged V's in comic sans. It gave the larger letterforms
          an interesting texture and graphic element. I then put the rest of the
          important info at the bottom.</p>

        <p>This design reminds me how some posters were
          made in the psychadelic era of design. They share the feature of the
          information serving as a graphic texture and quality, however I think
          mine is considerably more legible.

        <h2>Typographic art forms and close-ups</h2>

        <p>I created and drew this character when I was first learning Adobe Illustrator.
        Not only did this class project make me understand the tools in Ai, but it
        introduced a program that I call home for much of my graphic design work.
        I used the tools at hand to create artwork this time, but it also made me
        fluent with the adobe tools as well. This fox is supposed to be one who has
        adopted the human "hipster" look and lifestyle. All he needs is a smartphone.
        This was completed in 2015, age 20.</p>

        <h2>Type arrangement and grids</h2>

        <p>This was a painting that I did with oil paints as a gift to my boyfriend.
          He introduced me to the artist Kid Cudi and so I painted this for him as
          a gift. It is a "portrait" of his second album, "Man on the Moon: II". I
          used everything that comes with oil painting (the brushes, the medium,
          the paint thinner) to bring this painting to life. It is the second oil
          painting I had ever done. In my portraiture works, I like to capture the beauty
          of the subject. I am quite proud with the way I captured Kid Cudi in his
          album artwork. This was completed 2016, age 21.</p>
